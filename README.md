# Color Detection using a machine learning algorithm

" This research is based on what I see around my friends, and people around my community, who have problems with visuals, or even blind people just want to know about the color "

## Tech Stack

- React 
- TailwindCSS
- Vite ( Toolchain )
- Typescript ( for type safety )
- Nextjs ( framework that I used for simpler setup )

## Algorithm

Im using CIE76 for matching algorithms and combining RGB numbers to get predictions more closely

## Datasets

Im used XKCD and CMYK for color names and by combining both of them, the total list of colors is 1114.
